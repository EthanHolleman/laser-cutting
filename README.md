## Glowforge tips

- The recommended cut setting provided by Glowforge for medium acrylic sheets will not give you a clean cut.
Either reduce speed or cut with two passes to ensure your part releases on the first attempt. Repeating a cut
after a run is complete is very risky because the repeatability of Glowforge between prints seems to be low
and the second run may not line up exactly with the first, ruining the print.
